### Hi there 👋

I'm Chi Vong from Sweden. I'm currently a Front-End Developer with the goal to become Fullstack Developer. Until then, I will continue to learn and challenge myself.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js and code testing with Jest and Cypress
- 💻 I work with this tech: ReactJS, GatsbyJS, Next.js, GraphQL, TypeScript, Storybook
- 🍎 I snack on: fruits and vegetables
- 😁 I really enjoy: watching sci-fi movies, traveling and learning new things
- 🌴 When I'm not coding: I go for walks or hanging out with friends

#### 🚀 Let's work together

I am currently looking for job opporunities. Kindly reach out to me if there are job opportunities you'd love me to know about. If it is just to say hi, my inbox is always open. Feel free to drop me a message.
