### Hi there 👋

I'm Chi Vong from Stockholm, Sweden.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deno, Next.js and code testing with Jest and Cypress
- 💻 I work with this tech: ReactJS, GatsbyJS, Next.js, GraphQL, TypeScript, Deno
- 🍎 I snack on: fruits and vegetables
- 😁 I really enjoy: watching sci-fi movies, traveling and learning new things
- 🌴 When I'm not coding: I go for walks or hanging out with friends
